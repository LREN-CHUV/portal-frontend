# MIP portal frontend

## Libraries
- AngularJS v1.6.8
- Bootstrap v3.3.7

## Frontend development
This is a minimal setup to do frontend development in this project:
1. Checkout the frontend_dev branch of the `compose-everything-locally` project and run it. You will have the MIP backend running on your computer with no frontend.
2. Install gulp & yarn global
  * `npm install -g gulp` (might require `sudo`)
  * `npm install -g yarn` (might require `sudo`)
3. Install npm`:
  * `yarn install` (might require `sudo`)
4. Run the `portal-frontend`:
  * `gulp`
  * `google-chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir http://localhost:8000` (opens the frontend in Chrome with flags to ignore CORS issues. CORS must be disabled for development because the backend runs on a different domain name than the frontend)

## Develop & debug
1. Run: `./run.sh`
2. Open Browsersync External Access URL `google-chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir http://localhost:8000`
(might be another access URL)

## Build

Run: `./build.sh`

## Publish on Docker Hub

Run: `./publish.sh`


## Unit-tests 
### using gulp
This is a setup to run unit-tests in this project using gulp:
1. To run unit-tests ones:
  * `gulp unit-tests`
2. Start running karma unit tests:
  * `gulp unit-tests:auto`

### using karma-cli
This is a setup to run unit-tests in this project using karma-cli:
1. Install karma-cli & phantomjs global
  * `npm install karma-cli phantomjs -g` (might require `sudo`)
2. Start karma unit tests:
  * `karma start karma.conf.js` (might require `sudo`)
  
  
## e2e-tests 
e2e-testing works in chrome browser
### using gulp
This is a setup to run unit-tests in this project using gulp:
1. To run e2e-tests:
  * `gulp e2e-test` (it starts serve "dist" folder with dev config)
  To run e2e test without rebuild dist folder use `gulp protractor-go` command in new terminal window


### using protractor global
This is a setup to run e2e-tests in this project using protractor:
1. Install protractor global, webdriver-manager
  * `npm install -g protractor` (might require `sudo`) This will install two command line tools, protractor and webdriver-manager
  * `webdriver-manager update` (might require `sudo`)
  * `webdriver-manager start` (might require `sudo`)
