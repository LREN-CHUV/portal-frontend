# MIP portal frontend

## Libraries
- AngularJS v1.6.8
- Bootstrap v3.3.7

## Frontend development
This is a minimal setup to do frontend development in this project:
1. Checkout the frontend_dev branch of the `compose-everything-locally` project and run it. You will have the MIP backend running on your computer with no frontend.
2. Install gulp & yarn global
  * `npm install -g gulp` (might require `sudo`)
  * `npm install -g yarn` (might require `sudo`)
3. Install npm`:
  * `yarn install` (might require `sudo`)
4. Run the `portal-frontend`:
  * `gulp`
  * `google-chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir http://localhost:8000` (opens the frontend in Chrome with flags to ignore CORS issues. CORS must be disabled for development because the backend runs on a different domain name than the frontend)

## Develop & debug
1. Run: `./run.sh`
2. Open Browsersync External Access URL `google-chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir http://localhost:8000`
(might be another access URL)

## Build

Run: `./build.sh`

## Publish on Docker Hub

Run: `./publish.sh`
